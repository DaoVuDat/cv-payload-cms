        With experience as a freelance optimization expert, specifically in construction, I've mastered applying
        metaheuristics to real-world challenges. This has honed my skills in analytical thinking, system design, and
        performance optimization. I'm excited to bring this unique perspective and my development capabilities to a
        backend or frontend role.
